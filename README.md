Logical circuit simulation with Logical Circuit Simulator android app

During the study as a software engineer I created and simulated a series of logical component on my phone while I was coming back from the university, I used a mobile app called Logic Circuit Sim. In this repository it is possible to find some of this circuit, keep in mind that some might be implemented erronus due to the lack of some component on the simulator.
