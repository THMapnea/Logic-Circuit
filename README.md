Logical circuit schematic and simulation files with Logical Circuit Simulator android app

During the study as a software engineer I created and simulated a series of logical component on my phone while I was coming back from the university, I used a mobile app called Logic Circuit Sim. In this repository it is possible to find some of this circuit, keep in mind that some might be implemented erronus due to the lack of some component on the simulator. Inside this repository you will find both the .txt file to import in the app and a .png file to see how it resulted to me. Keep in mind that all this have been created using IC so you might need to buy the complete version of the app, to properly create the component that's why i loades also the png, for those who canno't afford to pay for the Pro version. Some image might not appear complete unfortunately, due to the software used, however the txt file contains all that is necessary to simulate the circuit in-app.
